# Changelog

Each version's **Highlights** block is what appears in the in-app update dialog. Keep it to ~5 short bullets grouped under `### New` / `### Fixed`. Everything below **Details** is full notes for GitHub / readdown.app.

## 1.18

### New
- Copy the file's path from the header's folder button, the File menu, or ⌥⌘C, ready to paste into a terminal or editor
- YAML front matter at the top of a file shows as a code block instead of being parsed as Markdown
- Pick Light or Dark in the View menu to read in a different appearance than macOS
- Links to other apps (codex://, vscode://, obsidian://) open after a confirmation that names the app; nothing is remembered between clicks

### Fixed
- Long labels in Mermaid flowcharts wrap inside their box instead of being cut off
- Highlighted code blocks no longer show a lighter band behind the text
- ⌘ while scrolling no longer zooms the page; pinch or ⌘+ and ⌘− still zoom

### Details

**New**

- **Copy Path.** The header's folder button now opens a menu with Show in Finder and Copy Path, which copies the document's full path to the clipboard. Also in the File menu, with the same ⌥⌘C shortcut Finder uses. (Issue #28, thanks @troelskn.)
- **Front matter.** A YAML block between `---` lines at the very top of a file (agent skills, Jekyll, Hugo, Obsidian) renders as a `yaml` code block. A `---` anywhere else is still a horizontal rule. (Issue #29, thanks @troelskn.)
- **Appearance.** View > Appearance switches Readdown between System, Light, and Dark. The choice is remembered and applies to every window; Quick Look keeps following macOS. (Issue #32, thanks @csbertran.)
- **Links to other apps.** A link whose scheme belongs to an app on your Mac, written as `[text](codex://…)` or `<codex://…>`, now opens that app after a confirmation naming it and showing the link. Every click asks, and nothing is remembered. If no app on the Mac handles the scheme, the header says so. Links that reach files, shares or remote hosts, run scripts or automation, or open system panes stay plain text, and Quick Look never opens anything. Bare `codex://…` text without link syntax stays text, as on GitHub. (Issue #31, thanks @justin808.)

**Fixed**

- Long identifiers in Mermaid flowchart nodes now wrap and the node grows to fit, instead of the text being clipped at the node's edge. (PR #27, thanks @skykeyjoker.)
- Syntax-highlighted code sat on a slightly lighter background than its block in light mode. Both now match.
- A code fence indented four or more spaces was dropped from the page instead of showing as text.
- Holding ⌘ while scrolling no longer zooms the page, so reaching for a shortcut mid-scroll can't change the text size. Pinch on the trackpad, or ⌘+, ⌘− and ⌘0, still zoom and reset. (Issue #30, thanks @max-jardetzky.)
- A link whose address starts with an invisible control character is now checked the way the browser reads it, so it can no longer slip past the link safety rules.
- Show in Finder and Copy Path share one folder button in the header; every header button shows a tooltip with its shortcut; confirmations and notices appear centred in the header.

## 1.17

### New
- Copy keeps its formatting: paste into Docs, Word, or Mail and your headings, lists, and tables survive

### Fixed
- Base64-embedded images (`data:image/...`) now render, instead of showing as raw text
- Math renders when you print or export a PDF
- Code blocks are easier to read, and long lines wrap instead of hiding off the edge
- Cmd+F reopens the search box with your last search selected, ready to type over

**New**

- **Rich copy.** Copying a selection, or the whole document from the header pill, now puts clean formatted text on the clipboard alongside the plain Markdown. Pasting into Google Docs, Word, or Mail keeps your headings, lists, tables, and links, and lets the destination apply its own styles instead of carrying Readdown's page colours and fonts across with it. Equations paste as their TeX source, Mermaid diagrams as their diagram source, and task checkboxes as ☐ and ☑. Plain-text editors still receive the raw Markdown, so nothing changes there.

**Fixed**

- Images embedded directly in a document as base64 data URIs (`![alt](data:image/png;base64,...)`, common in exports from Notion, Obsidian, and pandoc) now render as images. Previously the data URI was blocked and the base64 was shown as raw text. Data URIs stay blocked for links, and non-image data URIs (like `data:text/html`) still cannot render. (Issue #18, thanks @javafanboy.)
- Pressing Cmd+F while the find bar is already open now returns focus to it and selects the current search, so you can type straight over it. (Issue #23, thanks @Christopher-Crawford, who also sent the fix.)
- Equations now render when printing and when exporting to PDF. They previously came out as raw TeX.
- Code blocks sit on a slightly deeper background so they read as blocks on the off-white page, and long lines wrap instead of vanishing behind a horizontal scroll. Four syntax colours were adjusted to meet AA contrast on the new background.
- Files saved as UTF-32 now open correctly instead of appearing full of gaps.
- Closing a window with the red button no longer risks a crash the next time a window opens.
- The "What's new" screen appears only after an actual update, rather than every time the welcome window is reopened.

**Security**

- Links that hid a `javascript:` scheme behind HTML character references or an embedded tab are now caught by the URL check. Both forms would previously have been passed through to the browser engine, which decodes them before navigating.

## 1.16

### New
- **Math rendering** — inline (`$x^2$` or `\(x^2\)`) and display-block (`$$...$$` or `\[...\]`) TeX equations, fully offline
- Collapsible headings: fold a section away with the chevron in the margin
- Links to another local Markdown file now reveal the target in Finder

### Fixed
- Sharper Markdown: nested and mixed lists, setext headings, reference links and images, and clickable bare URLs
- Display math on the line right after a paragraph now renders as its own block
- Stronger handling of raw HTML inside documents

### Details

_Readdown 1.16 is sponsored by [Eixo](https://eixo.design). Make better product decisions and build with confidence in the age of AI._

**New**

- TeX math rendering via a bundled KaTeX (fonts embedded, fully offline). Math is detected and stashed before Markdown processing begins, so underscores and asterisks inside expressions are never treated as emphasis delimiters. Dollar amounts in prose (`$5` and `$10`) are not mistaken for math.
  - Inline syntax: `$x^2$` or `\(x^2\)`
  - Display (block) syntax: `$$\int_0^1 f(x)\,dx$$` (on its own line) or a `\[...\]` block
  - Renders correctly inside blockquotes
  - Graceful fallback: if a TeX expression fails to parse, the raw source is shown in a monospace font rather than crashing
- Collapsible headings (issue #11). Every heading gets a small chevron in the left margin; click it (or the heading) to fold the section beneath it. Subtle by default and out of the way until you reach for it.
- Following a relative link to another local `.md` or text file reveals it in Finder, so you can open it from there. (Readdown is sandboxed and can't open a sibling file you never selected, so it surfaces the target instead.)

**Fixed**

- Lists are more faithful: nested ordered lists, mixed bullet-and-number nesting, and loose items (blank line between them) all render with the right structure.
- Setext headings: a line underlined with `===` becomes an H1 and one underlined with `---` becomes an H2.
- Reference-style links and images (`[text][ref]`, `![alt][ref]`, and the collapsed/shortcut forms) now resolve, and links and images accept an optional title.
- Bare URLs in text (`https://example.com`) become clickable links, with trailing sentence punctuation left outside the link.
- Backslash escapes (`\*`, `\_`, `\[`, and the rest) render as literal characters instead of formatting.
- A display-math block (`$$...$$`) on the line immediately after a paragraph, with no blank line between them, now splits into its own centered equation instead of being pulled into the paragraph.
- A thematic break (`***` or `---`) directly under a list, with no blank line, now closes the list and draws a rule instead of being folded into the last item.
- Copying the document reflects the file on disk even after a whitespace-only change.
- Raw HTML passed through from a document is now governed by an allowlist of safe tags and attributes, so ordinary formatting still works while scripts and inline event handlers are neutralized.

**Thanks**

- @adivijaykumar for the math rendering contribution (issue #13, PR #14).

## 1.15

### New
- A cleaner reading view with a floating header: the file name and quick actions (copy, find, show in Finder) tuck into the title bar
- Copy the whole document, or any single code block, to the clipboard in one click
- Optional, anonymous usage stats to guide what gets improved, off unless you opt in

### Fixed
- Opening a file no longer reopens your entire previous session on top of it
- Mermaid diagrams re-theme instantly on light and dark switch, and printing or exporting to PDF from dark mode now comes out light
- Ordered lists keep their starting number, and bold or italic spanning a wrapped line inside a list item now render (issues #15, #16)

### Details

**New**

- A redesigned window with a floating header. The file name sits in its own pill next to the traffic lights, and a matching pill holds Copy to Clipboard, Find, and Show in Finder. The title bar is transparent so the document reads full width, with a soft blur under the header as you scroll. Show in Finder is also in the File menu and on ⇧⌘R.
- Copy to Clipboard copies the document's full Markdown source, with a checkmark to confirm. Every fenced code block gets its own copy button on hover.
- A redesigned About window with links to leave feedback, report a bug, or support the project.
- Optional usage stats. If you opt in, through a one-time prompt or the Help menu, Readdown sends an anonymous daily count of which features you use, along with the app and macOS version. There are no identifiers of any kind, and your documents never leave your Mac. It is off unless you say yes, and you can change your mind anytime in the Help menu.

**Fixed**

- Opening a file at launch now shows just that file. The app could previously restore your entire previous session first, burying the file you opened underneath it. Launching without a file, from the Dock or after an update, still restores your open documents.
- Mermaid diagrams re-theme the moment the system appearance changes, instead of staying in the old palette until the document is reopened.
- Printing and exporting to PDF from dark mode now produce light pages, so paper no longer inherits the dark theme (Mermaid diagrams especially, whose colors are baked into the diagram).
- Ordered lists starting at a number other than 1 (such as `2.`) now keep that start number instead of renumbering from 1 (issue #16).
- Inline bold and italic that span a wrapped line inside a list item now render, the same way they already did in paragraphs (issue #15).

**Thanks**

- @jantomec for the code-block copy button (PR #12).
- @troelskn for reporting the ordered-list and wrapped-emphasis issues (#15, #16).

## 1.14.1

### Fixed
- Heading anchor links now match GitHub's slug convention for headings with stripped punctuation (e.g. `# Foo — bar` produces `foo--bar`, not `foo-bar`), so anchor links from GitHub-style TOCs scroll to the right place

### Details

**Fixed**

- `# Foo — bar` and similar headings (with whitespace-surrounded punctuation that gets stripped) now produce GitHub-compatible slugs. The previous slug generator collapsed runs of whitespace into a single hyphen; GitHub converts each whitespace character individually, preserving consecutive hyphens. Without this fix, `[link](#foo--bar)` from a TOC silently failed to scroll.

**Thanks**

- @ReubenCowell — first-time contributor, caught and reported (PR #10).

## 1.14

### Fixed
- Documents with a paragraph line beginning with `#` followed by a digit (e.g. `#24`) no longer freeze the app (issue #8)
- Fenced code blocks inside list items render as real code blocks again (issue #9)
- Heading anchor links (`#section`) inside a document scroll to the target instead of being silently cancelled
- Underscores inside words (`snake_case`, `lots_of_underscores`) are no longer mistaken for italic/bold delimiters
- Mermaid diagrams in dark mode are legible again — every text label now picks up the dark theme
- Readdown no longer hangs at launch when the previous session's documents have moved or been deleted

### Details

**Fixed**

- Renderer no longer hangs on a paragraph line that starts with `#` immediately followed by a non-space character (issue #8). The paragraph collector previously rejected those lines on a bare `#`-prefix check while the heading parser rejected them for lacking a space — leaving the renderer with no branch that could claim the line. A defensive guard now also catches any future no-advance regression rather than risk a freeze.
- Fenced code blocks indented under a list item are recognized again and render as `<pre><code>` blocks inside the list item (issue #9). They had been silently absorbed into the surrounding prose because the continuation parser only checked for fences at column zero.
- Clicking a heading anchor link inside an open document now scrolls to the heading instead of being cancelled. The same-document check has been relaxed to tolerate the two real shapes the loader produces (an `about:blank` page URL for untitled docs and a trailing-slash mismatch for saved docs) while still routing external links with fragments to the system browser.
- Intra-word underscores stay literal. The underscore emphasis patterns now require word-boundary flanking (CommonMark §6.2), so `snake_case` identifiers, `lots_of_underscores_in_names`, and `some__double__underscores` render as plain text instead of italicising or bolding fragments of the word. Asterisk emphasis (`*italic*`, `**bold**`) is unchanged.
- Mermaid diagrams render correctly in dark mode. The previous detection (`window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`) can return the wrong answer inside WKWebView — leaving every Mermaid diagram in its light palette on a dark page (invisible edge labels, dark-on-dark sequence messages, dark-on-dark pie chart legends). A luminance-based fallback now also checks the page's resolved background colour, so dark mode is reliably detected on screen.
- Readdown no longer hangs at launch when the previous session's saved documents have been moved or deleted (e.g. after a force-quit, sudden power off, or Time Machine restore). Two restoration mechanisms — Readdown's own and AppKit's automatic one — had been racing at launch; AppKit's path has no file-existence guard, so a stale doc reference could deadlock the app indefinitely. AppKit's redundant path is now disabled.

**Thanks**

- Issues #8 and #9 were reported by @troelskn — thank you.

## 1.13

### Fixed
- Code spans render exactly as written — underscores, asterisks, and HTML tags inside backticks stay literal
- Nested bullet lists render correctly
- Markdown files saved with a UTF-8 byte-order mark open cleanly
- Refined task-list checkboxes
- Mermaid diagrams use a refreshed theme that reads well in both light and dark mode

### Details

**Fixed**

- Inline code spans now render their content fully verbatim. Characters that would normally be interpreted as Markdown (underscores, asterisks) or as HTML (`<div>`, `<em>`, etc.) stay as plain text inside the code style. This also resolves a cascading bold/italic effect that could appear later in a document when a code span contained an HTML tag.
- Nested bullet lists now render inside the parent list item instead of as a sibling list — correct nesting and spacing.
- Files saved with a UTF-8 byte-order mark open cleanly. A first-line heading is recognized as a heading, not as paragraph text starting with an invisible character.
- Task-list checkboxes use a centered SVG checkmark and tighter label spacing.
- Mermaid diagrams: refreshed theme variables for both modes — edge labels (Yes/No) sit on a solid background that matches the document, arrows and text are tuned per mode for contrast, and the pie chart palette is high-contrast so small slices stay legible (issue #7).

**Under the hood**

- Update checks now send anonymous system info (macOS version, Mac model, CPU type) — no identifiers, no personal data — so we know which macOS versions to keep supporting.

## 1.12

### New
- Refreshed typography — warmer text, a cleaner heading scale, and restyled links and tables
- Linkable headings — every heading gets an anchor, so in-page `#section` links jump and scroll

### Fixed
- Quick Look previews no longer hang on a loading spinner on some recent macOS builds
- Open documents now reliably reappear after an update or relaunch

### Details

**New**

- Typography pass: warmer body text on a softer off-white background, a modular heading scale with balanced spacing, an always-on subtle link underline, and restyled tables. Dark-mode secondary text was brightened to meet WCAG AA contrast.
- Linkable headings: every heading now has a GitHub-style anchor (e.g. `getting-started`), so links to `#section` within a document jump to and smoothly scroll to the heading.

**Fixed**

- Quick Look: the preview extension relied on a private WebKit setting that some recent macOS builds no longer recognize, which left the preview stuck on a loading spinner. It has been removed — previews render reliably again.
- Documents that were open are now restored correctly after a Sparkle auto-update or relaunch; a timing issue that could drop the saved session on quit was fixed.

## 1.11

### New
- Live refresh — documents update automatically when edited in another app
- Refreshed window chrome — larger rounded corners and a cleaner title bar on macOS Tahoe
- Thin auto-hiding scrollbar
- Redesigned find bar

### Fixed
- Open documents reopen automatically after relaunch (Sparkle update, login, force-quit)
- Pinch-to-zoom now matches Cmd-scroll range (50%–300%) instead of stopping at 100%

### Details

**New**

- Live refresh: if you edit a Markdown file in VS Code, Obsidian, or any other editor, Readdown reloads the rendered view automatically and shows a small "Updated" indicator. Scroll position is preserved across reloads.
- Window chrome polish: on macOS Tahoe (26+), windows use a unified-compact toolbar and the larger native corner radius that matches Messages, Mail, and Bear. The title bar background flows continuously into the document area.
- Auto-hiding scrollbar: the side scrollbar is invisible at rest and fades in for a moment when you scroll.
- Find bar redesign: floating capsule near the top of the window instead of a full-width flush sheet.

**Fixed**

- Documents you had open before quitting (or before a Sparkle auto-update) reopen automatically on next launch via macOS state restoration.
- Pinch-to-zoom on the trackpad now uses the same 50%–300% range as Cmd-scroll and Cmd+/Cmd-. Previously WebKit's built-in handler clamped to 100% as the minimum, so you couldn't pinch out below the default size.

## 1.10

### New
- Fluid layout — documents reflow as you resize the window
- Window cascading when you open multiple files
- Zoom in / out / reset (Cmd +, Cmd -, Cmd 0), pinch and Cmd-scroll to zoom
- Find in document (Cmd+F) with live match counter

### Fixed
- "Set as Default" now prompts automatically on first launch
- Soft line breaks no longer force hard breaks — paragraphs reflow naturally
- HTML entities (`&copy;`, `&ndash;`, …) render correctly
- Wikipedia-style URLs with parens and underscores now work
- PDF / print output preserves syntax highlighting, rules, and checkbox fills

### Details

**Added**

- Fluid body width — document adapts to the window, resize freely and text reflows like a terminal.
- Window cascading — opening multiple files offsets each window instead of stacking them.
- Zoom in/out/reset via Cmd+=, Cmd-, Cmd+0. Pinch-zoom and Cmd-scroll also work.
- Find in document (Cmd+F) with match count, next/previous navigation, and auto-scroll to the current match.
- Autolinks — bare URLs in `<https://…>` and emails in `<you@example.com>` are clickable.
- HTML entities (`&copy;`, `&ndash;`, `&#169;`, `&#xA9;`) render as their characters, per CommonMark.
- HTML comments hidden instead of appearing as literal text.

**Fixed**

- Soft newlines in source no longer force hard `<br>` breaks — paragraphs reflow naturally.
- List item continuation lines flow inline with their item.
- Script tags inside code spans (or anywhere in text) are safely escaped — no more preview cutoff mid-document.
- "Set as Default" prompts automatically on first launch. Older macOS versions show manual setup instructions instead.
- Wikipedia-style links `/wiki/Foo_(bar)` with parentheses in the URL now work.
- Underscores, asterisks, tildes, and backticks inside URLs no longer get interpreted as markdown emphasis.
- PDF/print output now preserves syntax highlighting, horizontal rules, table stripes, and task-list checkbox fills.

## 1.9.3

### Highlights
- Security hardening for HTML passthrough
- Quick Look font fix
- Code block styling polish

## 1.9.2

### Highlights
- Fix Sparkle auto-update installer error on sandboxed builds
